# Higher Level Languages

Higher level languages like [Swift](https://swift.org) are useful as they abstract a lot of the tedious work to functions and 
methods built into the language. Another benefit of higher level languages is automated memory management which saves time and lines of code written.

> [!NOTE]
> The CS50 Course actually utilises Python to teach higher level languages however as I am learning Swift at the moment and rarely use Python I decided it was better for me to utilise this language. In terms of the features and functionality Swift provides much of the same abstractions as Python.

A lot of this section is completed within the [Examples.playground](./Examples.playground) file which will require Xcode to open and run the files. I will include some notes in this `README.md` file for continuity's sake however the program examples are within the Playground.
