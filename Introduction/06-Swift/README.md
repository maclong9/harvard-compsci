# Higher Level Languages

In this section of the course we will be focusing on Python, a higher level language commonly used in Artfiical Intelligence and Data Science.

Higher level languages have a large advantage when it comes to third party libraries that further abstract away code that may be required more than once. For example a facial recognition library that can be used to detect faces or a graphing package for plotting graphs using data. This can save you a lot of time when building tools and applications in comparison to building each feature manually each time.

Python is an interpreted language, this means you don't need to compile it before running, this allows you to iterate much faster however comes at the drawback of possible lower performance, this is due to Python managing memory for you instead of manually like in C through `malloc` for most simple programs though the difference will not be noticeable.

> [!NOTE]
> As I have wanted to learn Swift for a while, you can also find a Swift Playground in this folder containing the examples from this lecture solved in Swift. User inputs are hardcoded however could easily be switched for a user input when creating a Swift CLI Tool, Playgrounds do not accept user input however.
