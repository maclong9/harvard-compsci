Python is an interpreted la

> You use a set instead of an array when you need to test efficiently for membership and you arenâ€™t concerned with the order of the elements in the collection, or when you need to ensure that each element appears only once in a collection. - [Apple Developer Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set)

Higher level languages have a large advantage when it comes to third party libraries that further abstract away code that may be required more than once. For example a facial recognition library that can be used to detect faces or a graphing package for plotting graphs using data. This can save you a lot of time when building tools and applications in comparison to building each feature manually each time.

In this section of the course we will be focusing on Python, a higher level language commonly used in Artfiical INtelligence and Data Science.
