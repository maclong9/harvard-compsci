- pixels are used to display images.
- because they are blocky sometimes images can appear also blocky.
- the more pixels a screen has the more _smooth_ and image can appear.
- you can relate pixels to binary digits, $0 = black and 1 = white$.
- an image files is kind of just a pattern of 0's and 1's.
