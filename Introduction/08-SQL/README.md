# Relational Databases with SQL

Structured Query Langage, SQL from here onward, is a relational database implemenation with a variety of flavours that can be used to store various data for your programs.

## Data

Where C and Swift are focused on logic and getting tasks completed, SQL is focused on data; storing and querying data. 

A _flat-file_ database is a database expressed in plain text, with the most common variety being CSV which is _Comma Seperated Value_ which uses a `,` as a delimiter to seperate the data. You can see an example of this file type in `./mac.csv` that displays a history of Macintosh computers.
