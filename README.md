# Harvard Computer Science

Harvard University are lovely enough to publish their CS50 courses in various computer science topics ranging
from Artificial Intelligence to Cyber Security online for free via [EDX](https://www.edx.org/cs50).

This repository contains my notes, examples and projects from these courses. Feel free to utilise my notes to
help with your learning of computer science.
